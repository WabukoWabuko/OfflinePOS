# OfflinePOS Requirements

Hey there! This document outlines everything we need to build a kickass offline-first POS system. It’s written like a friendly guide, so even if you’re new to this, you’ll get the big picture. Let’s break it down.

## 1. User Authentication
- **What it does**: Lets users (cashiers, admins) log in securely.
- **Features**:
  - Username/password login with encrypted storage.
  - Role-based access: Admins can manage products/settings; cashiers can only process sales.
  - Logout option and session timeout for security.
- **Why it matters**: Keeps the system secure and ensures only authorized folks can access sensitive features.

## 2. System Modules
- **What it does**: The core features of the POS system.
- **Modules**:
  - **Product Management**: Add, edit, delete products (name, price, stock, barcode).
  - **Sales Processing**: Scan barcodes or select products, calculate totals, apply discounts, process payments (cash/card).
  - **Customer Tracking**: Store customer info (name, email, purchase history) for loyalty programs.
  - **Transaction History**: View past sales with filters (date, customer, cashier).
  - **Receipts**: Generate and print receipts (or save as PDF).
- **Why it matters**: These are the bread-and-butter features that make the POS useful for businesses.

## 3. Settings Panel
- **What it does**: Lets users tweak the app to their liking.
- **Features**:
  - Manage user profiles (update password, name, etc.).
  - Switch between light/dark themes.
  - Configure cloud sync settings (enable/disable, server URL).
  - Backup/restore local data to/from a file.
  - Customize app branding (name, logo, colors).
- **Why it matters**: Gives users control and makes the app feel personal and flexible.

## 4. Local Storage
- **What it does**: Stores all data locally for offline use.
- **Details**:
  - Uses SQLite for products, sales, customers, and settings.
  - Data persists even if the app restarts or the device shuts down.
  - Stored in a Docker volume or local filesystem for portability.
- **Why it matters**: Ensures the app works without internet, perfect for areas with spotty connectivity.

## 5. Cloud Sync (Optional)
- **What it does**: Backs up data to a cloud server when online.
- **Features**:
  - Automatic sync when internet is detected.
  - Manual sync trigger from settings.
  - Clear online/offline status in the UI.
  - Uses PostgreSQL for cloud storage.
- **Why it matters**: Protects data and allows multi-device access for businesses with multiple locations.

## 6. Responsive UI
- **What it does**: Makes the app look good and work well on any desktop.
- **Details**:
  - Built with Flet for touch and mouse support.
  - Clean, modern design with intuitive navigation.
  - Dialogs for confirmations (e.g., “Delete product?”).
  - Optimized for different screen sizes.
- **Why it matters**: A great user experience keeps cashiers happy and customers moving quickly.

## 7. File Handling
- **What it does**: Lets users export/import data and print receipts.
- **Features**:
  - Export sales data as CSV.
  - Import product lists from CSV.
  - Print receipts to a connected printer or save as PDF.
- **Why it matters**: Makes it easy to integrate with other tools and provide physical receipts.

## 8. Extra Goodies
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light/dark themes.
- **Localization**: Support multiple languages via JSON files.
- **Error Logging**: Save errors locally and optionally send to Sentry for cloud deployments.
- **Customization**: Let businesses rebrand the app (logo, colors, name).
- **Why it matters**: These polish the app and make it more appealing to buyers.

## 9. Deployment
- **What it does**: Gets the app onto users’ computers.
- **Details**:
  - Package as native binaries (`.exe` for Windows, `.app` for macOS, `.AppImage` for Linux).
  - Dockerized setup for consistent development and deployment.
  - One-click installer with auto-start for kiosks.
- **Why it matters**: Easy setup means more businesses will adopt it.

This is the blueprint for our POS system. Next, we’ll design the database and start coding!
